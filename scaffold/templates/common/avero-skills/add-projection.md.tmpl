# Add a projection

A projection reads an event stream and writes a read model. The projection
runner arrives with S9 of the host. Until then, write the read model in the
same transaction as the change that it follows.

## Steps

1. Write the read model table with `avero migrate new <name>`.
2. Write the update of the read model inside the handler transaction, so the
   two writes commit together.
3. Write the test that proves that the read model matches the source after a
   change and after a failure.

## The command that proves the work

```
avero verify
```
